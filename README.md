So far we've got simple face detection - but it's the first step toward recognition.

##Setup
You'll need to download and install the opencv libraries

On Mac you can just use homebrew:
```bash
brew update
brew install opencv
```

##Needs
* face training
* face recognition
* server to host it all and send images to
  * take an image
  * try to recognize
* some sort of alert
